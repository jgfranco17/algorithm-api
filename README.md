## 🔎 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is meant to showcase the concepts of API design and DevOps that I have learned so far. This project features CI/CD workflows and automations, unittesting, and containerization. Git & Github were used as the VCS. I dub this as "Algorithms-as-a-Service".

This program aims to create a Gin-based microservice that solves some classic programming problems. The Algorithm Microservice API provides a simple HTTP-based API to solve some of these problems. This microservice can be easily integrated into other applications or used for testing and learning purposes.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the Algorithm Microservice API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Golang 1.18 or above

### Installing

Instructions will be added as the project develops.

## 🚀 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

### Dev mode

To run the API server in dev mode, simply execute either of the following commands:

```bash
# Default Go execution
go run service/cmd/main.go

# Justfile command runner
just run
```

Instructions will be added as the project develops.

### Calling the API

Instructions will be added as the project develops.

## 🔧 Testing <a name = "testing"></a>

### Running unittest suite

Instructions will be added as the project develops.
